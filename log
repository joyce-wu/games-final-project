I discussed my solution with: Ashley Qin.

DISCUSSION

After implementing the my throw function, my tests would take a really long time to run. It took many hours of
debugging to figure out that I had accidentally nested a for loop inside another for loop in the function. This
is a good reminder to always pay attention to indenting. I had difficulties with parameter tuning. I was 
playing around with different amounts to add to the scores before starting from the beginning and setting 
everything back to 0.25. Having this base improved my net score drastically, and the parameter tuning ended up
being unnecessarily complicated. Additionally, I had difficulty coming up with heuristics for pegging and 
thinking about the ways in which pairs can be really helpful.
